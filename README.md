# Service-Request-Application-CS305
Software to request maintenance services

## High Level Idea

- User takes a photo (ex: broken tap) and the application automatically predicts the required authority(ex: water department and help calling a plumber)
- Entire maintenance work flow (raise complaint -> solve issue by authorities -> feedback from complainant) 

## ToDo
1. Preparation of the [software requirements specification (SRS)](https://github.com/CS305-software-Engineering/Service-Request-Application-CS305/wiki/SRS) documentation.
2. Preparation of [High Level Design Document](https://github.com/CS305-software-Engineering/Service-Request-Application-CS305/wiki/High-Level-Design) and [Low Level Design Document](https://github.com/CS305-software-Engineering/Service-Request-Application-CS305/wiki/Low-Level-Design).
3. Construction of the software. This includes creating and maintaining the source code artifacts in a version control system (VCS) such as git repository.
4. Continuous build and delivery/deployment of the software.
5. Final deployment of the software.
